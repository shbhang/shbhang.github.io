<p id="one"> Next day, we moved to San Francisco <br>
I was so looking forward to it <br>
It does have many places to check </p>
    
<p id="two">  We went to Hayes Valley that had so much <br>
to see pastel colors of buildings <br>
and nice fashion and design items </p>

<p id="three">  Also, we rented a car so didn't have to walk <br>
It made our mood so much better <br>
we were getting excited!! </p>

<p id="four">so cute and sophisticated a city </p>
