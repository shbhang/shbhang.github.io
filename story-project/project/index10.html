<p id="america">WEED IN OHMERICA</p>
<p id="one"> But we also had fun <br>
When we went to Griffith Observatory <br>
we thought we could walk up there <br>
which turned out a very reckless idea </p>
    
<p id="two"> I said, </p>
    
<p id="three"> "Let's try hitch-hiking" <br>
At our 10th try, we met a sweet couple <br>
generously said ok for us </p>

<p id="four"> About five minutes later <br>
the guy in the car said, <br>
"Do you mind if I smoke?" <br>
Of course, we answered </p>

<p id="five">"Nope" </p>

<p id="six"> "It's weed" <br>
Mi-Kaang told me in Korean holding the nose <br>
becuase it makes her drunk fast </p>

<p id="seven"> It was hilarious <br>
as it was my very first time <br>
to smell the weed <br>
<i>(I didn't hold my nose)</i></p>
