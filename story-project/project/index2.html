<p id="one">Mi-Kaang and I first met in Seoul, Korea. <br>
We've been friends for nine years<br>
Then, Mi-Kaang had to leave for America<br> to study six years ago <br>
But, we were good talking over Facetime, Texts<br>
and she visited Korea pretty often until I left Seoul, too.<br>
After I started living in NY<br>
we couldn't meet for two or three years<br></p>


<p id="two"> So, we planned our reunion in California</p>
